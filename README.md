# XR500v OpenWrt port

OpenWrt port for the **TP-Link Archer XR500v** GPON router — SoC: EcoNet **EN751221** (MIPS 34Kc, big-endian).

## Status (2026-05-30) — FUNCTIONAL ✅

| Function | State |
|---|---|
| Boot to console (UART, A/B slot flash) | ✅ |
| **Ethernet LAN — 4 ports via DSA** | ✅ working (HW switching ~gigabit, CPU idle) |
| **PCIe / WiFi — dual band** | ✅ 5 GHz AP (MT7662 / `mt76x2e`) + 2.4 GHz AP (MT7603 / `mt7603e`) |
| **USB** (xHCI MediaTek + storage) | ✅ pendrive USB2 = `/dev/sda` |
| **256 MB RAM** | ✅ (244 MB usable) |
| **LAN TX throughput** | ✅ 161 Mbps as endpoint (BQL fix, was ~5M) |
| Bridge (4 LAN + WiFi) + persistent config + internet | ✅ |
| **Telephone / VoIP (RJ11 FXS)** | ✅ working — clean bidirectional SIP calls + ring/answer/hangup (reconstructed SLIC driver) |
| WAN / xPON (GPON fiber) | ❌ not supported (separate MAC block) |

**The breakthrough:** the EN751221 has **two cascaded MT7530 switches** — an on-die one (MMIO @ `0x1fb58000`, only port5 cascade + port6 CPU) and an external MCM one (over MDIO @ `0x1f`) that carries the 4 real LAN ports. Modeling this as a **nested DSA tree** (the MCM as a child of the on-die switch's MDIO bus) makes all 4 LAN ports + WiFi work, bridged, with internet — *without* needing the unpublished MDIO-master code that previously blocked this.

## Hardware
- SoC: EcoNet EN751221 (MIPS 34Kc, BE, ~600 MHz). SPI-NAND 128 MB. **256 MB DDR3**.
- Switch: dual MT7530 — on-die (MMIO `0x1fb58000`) + MCM (MDIO `0x1f`). 4× GE LAN.
- WiFi: **two** MediaTek PCIe radios — MT7662 (5 GHz, `mt76x2e`) + MT7603 (2.4 GHz, `mt7603e`). USB: xHCI (MediaTek).
- WAN: GPON (own MAC, not in OpenWrt). Phone: Microsemi **Le9642** SLIC over ZSI — reconstructed driver (see VoIP section).

## How to rebuild (this repo is an OVERLAY on top of cjdelisle/openwrt)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cjdelisle/openwrt.git && cd openwrt
git checkout f3605b31fb            # pinned base (branch plan-b-nazox1, tag iter84-snapshot)
cp -r <this-repo>/{package,target} .      # apply overlay
cp <this-repo>/config.seed .config        # USB selections + kernel diet + target
./scripts/feeds update -a && ./scripts/feeds install -a
make defconfig && make -j$(nproc)
```

**Pinned base:** `cjdelisle/openwrt` @ `f3605b31fb` (branch `plan-b-nazox1`).
**`config.seed`** captures what lives in `.config` (gitignored): USB packages (`kmod-usb3`, `usb-storage`, `usb-xhci-mtk`, `fs-vfat`, `fs-exfat`) + kernel diet (`KALLSYMS`/`DEBUG_INFO` off, required so the compressed kernel fits in the `kernel1` partition of 3 MB).

> ⚠️ **Lesson learned (important):** always run `make package/kernel/econet-eth/clean` before a fresh build, and **do NOT leave backup directories** (`*-bak`, `*-disabled`, `*.iter*`) under `package/`: OpenWrt scans all of `package/` and compiles those stale drivers in parallel, overwriting the correct one in the rootfs (this cost hours of "ethernet broken").

## Key technical notes
- **Nested DSA topology** — `target/linux/econet/dts/en751221.dtsi`: on-die `switch@1fb58000` with a child `mdio { switch@1f (mediatek,mcm) }`. MCM user PHYs at MDIO **1–4** (port0/PHY0 has no RJ45 jack).
- **Inverted port mapping** (enclosure ≠ Linux): physical LAN1→`lan1` (MCM port4), LAN2→`lan2` (port3), LAN3→`lan3` (port2), LAN4→`lan4` (port1). Corrected in `en751221_tplink_archer-xr500v.dts`.
- **USB** — node `usb@1fb90000` (mt8173-xhci). The USB3 port has no T-PHY wired → `STS1_U3_MAC_RST` never exits reset → `host_enable` timeout `-145`. Fix: `mediatek,u3p-dis-msk = <0x1>` (disables U3; USB2 port remains active). The `xhci-mtk` driver does NOT consume `phys`.
- **256 MB** — `memory@0 reg = <0x0 0x10000000>` in the board dts. Requires disabling INITRAMFS + kernel diet (otherwise the compressed kernel does not fit in `kernel1`=3 MB; `dd conv=sync` rounds up to the nearest 3072k multiple).
- **WiFi 2.4 GHz (MT7603)** — a *second* PCIe radio, separate from the 5 GHz MT7662. Two walls: enumeration needed the OEM global PCIe reset replicated at boot (the `mt7512_pcie_reset` sequence), and the `mt7603e` driver hung on the MCU EEPROM upload until a synthetic EEPROM was inlined in the DTS (`mediatek,eeprom-data` on the `wifi@0,0` node). 5 GHz (MT7662) runs on `mt76x2e`.
- **Tagger** — econet-eth carries its own `mtk-tag.ko` (from `gsw/tag-mtk.c`), *not* the kernel's `tag_mtk`. `mtk_conduit_find_user` is device-agnostic.
- **Operational gotcha** — the DSA conduit `eth0` must NOT be a member of `br-lan` (its bridge rx_handler bypasses the DSA tagger). `br-lan` = `lan1..lan4` (+ WiFi).
- **Flash** — only from stock OEM telnet `:2323` (mtd write from a running OpenWrt corrupts the NAND). TrendChip header patch required.
- **Persistent network** — the DSA bridge comes up correctly only on a **clean boot**, not with `network restart`.

## econet-eth driver patches (`package/kernel/econet-eth/patches/`)
- `210-mcm-reset-optional` — the MCM does not expose a reset register; make it optional.
- `220-mdio-bus-pre-dsa-register` — register the MCM PHYs before `dsa_register_switch` (otherwise `-ENODEV` on user ports).
- `240-trgmii-cascade-cal` — port of `macMT7530doP6Cal` TRGMII from the OEM SDK.
- `330-bql-min-limit` — **TX throughput fix**: `dql.min_limit=262144` on the GDM txqs. BQL was collapsing to ~86 bytes (QDMA signals TX-done per packet) → TX 5M → 161M (32×).

*(The PPE WIP patches 340/350 are in the git history, commit `39fb218`. They were removed from the functional build: software forwarding already achieves ~590M, HW NAT offload is not needed.)*

## VoIP / Telephone (FXS)  ✅

The XR500v's RJ11 phone jacks use a **Microsemi Le9642** SLIC (VE886/VP886 family)
over **ZSI** (Zarlink Serial Interface, multiplexed on the PCM bus) — "not
supported" by the EcoNet OpenWrt project. The full FXS/VoIP stack was reverse-
engineered and rebuilt from scratch: the SoC PCM/TDM DMA engine, the ZSI
transport, the SLIC profiles / line-state / ring, G.711 audio, and a SIP
integration. A point-to-point SIP call (PC softphone ↔ Philips DECT handset)
works clean **both directions**, with real **ring / answer / hangup**.

`package/kernel/econet-pcm/` builds two kernel modules — **`pcm-en751221`** (the
SoC PCM/TDM controller @ `0x1fbd0000`) and **`econet-slic`** (the Le9642 over ZSI
@ `0x1fbd1000`) — plus a baresip audio module exposing `/dev/xr500v-voice`
(16-bit linear, 8 kHz) and `xr500v-callmgr.c`, a small userspace daemon for the
call flow.

### Key technical notes
- **DC feed current** — the cordless DECT base needs more loop current than the
  600R AC profile default (ILA 0x07 = 25 mA); the mic stays marginal at the
  voice ADC until raised. `slic_audio_setup` bumps the DCFEED ILA to 38 mA
  (`feed_ila` param) — this alone removed the capture noise and hum.
- **u-law, not 16-bit linear** — the Le9642 drives only 8 bits per PCM timeslot
  even in "linear" mode, so 16-bit linear gave 8-bit resolution (quiet speech
  quantized to silence → choppy). The codec runs **G.711 u-law** and the voice
  thread (de)compands to/from 16-bit linear for the char device; u-law's log
  companding preserves quiet speech. The SLIC uses different clock-slot offsets
  for TX-capture (low byte) vs RX-playback (high byte) — the `tx_msb` param
  selects the playback byte.
- **OPFUNC before TXSLOT** — the codec mode must be written before the timeslots
  latch, or only one 8-bit slot is allocated.
- **Real call flow** (`xr500v-callmgr`) — ties the SLIC hook (debugfs) to
  baresip's `ctrl_tcp`: an incoming call rings the handset, going off-hook
  accepts, on-hook hangs up (no leftover line tone). The ring voltage (STATE
  0x07, 70–90 V) corrupts the SIGREG hook bit, so it rings with a cadence and
  samples the hook only in the gaps, debounced.
- **Persistence** — modules reload live without reflashing (the SLIC state only
  resets on a cold boot). The whole stack (fixed `.ko` + baresip + callmgr)
  persists via the UBIFS overlay (`/lib/modules`, `/root/bsdeploy`,
  `/root/voip-start.sh` launched from `rc.local`) — no firmware reflash needed.

The SLIC bring-up history (ZSI handshake, profiles, the ring milestone, the
codec saga) lives in the git history and `notes/`.

## Structure

- `package/kernel/linux/modules/netdevices.mk` — adds `TARGET_econet` to deps + defines `kmod-dsa-mt7530`.
- `target/linux/econet/` — DTS (SoC dtsi + XR500v board), `en751221/config-6.12`, image recipe, base-files, NAND patches.

- `scripts/`, `docs/`, `notes/` — tools and iteration log.

Built on EcoNet `econet/en751221` (Caleb DeLisle's port, merged to OpenWrt mainline 2025).
